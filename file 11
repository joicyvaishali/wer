Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.


code :-

class Solution {
  public:
    int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int ans=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        int minn,maxn;
        minn=arr[0];
        maxn=arr[n-1];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{if(arr[i]-k<0)
continue;
minn=min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
maxn=max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
ans=min(ans,maxn-minn);
    }
    return ans;
    }
};
